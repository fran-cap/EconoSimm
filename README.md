## A low cost Rom for SE/30 machines and compatables
Simply put this allows for a custom rom to be installed inside of a se/30 to skip things like the built in RAM check.
You can also use any extra space to fit in a small system file.

I've based this off of the work of [Doug Brown](https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/category/mac-rom-hacking/).
And GGlabs [MACSIMM](https://gglabs.us/node/2019).

You can find information about making a rom [here](http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator-ii/) (shoutouts to BMOW)
And how to make a custom disk image [here](http://www.bigmessowires.com/2016/07/22/rom-disk-creation-with-rom-inator-ii/).

The max size of any rom image will depend on the size of the flash chips you use but the max is 4 4mb chips or 2MB in total.
You can split any rom file you make into 4 pieces using the tool of your choice and burn that to each of the 4 chips.

## Note: The pcb has to be 1.2MM thick (approx) or it will not fit into a rom socket!

### You can program the cips individually with a standard flash programmer and a 32 PLCC -> dip adapter
BMOW's programmer may work but I have not tested it.

#### I'm not liable if this damages your Macintosh
